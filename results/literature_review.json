  "summary": "The field of asteroid lightcurve inversion is mature for convex shapes (Kaasalainen-Torppa method, 5700+ models in DAMIT) but significant opportunities remain in: (1) non-convex shape recovery via genetic algorithms (SAGE), (2) sparse data exploitation from Gaia/LSST surveys, (3) multi-modal data fusion (ADAM). Our pipeline synthesizes all three approaches with a focus on sparse data handling and non-convex refinement to model previously uncharacterized asteroids."
