  "analysis": {
    "overall_assessment": "Our LCI pipeline demonstrates promising period recovery capability but falls significantly short on pole determination and shape fidelity compared to established tools. The performance gap is partly explained by data volume differences (our 3-27 sessions vs published 50-109 lightcurves) and partly by algorithmic limitations that can be addressed.",

    "strengths": {
      "period_recovery": "Period accuracy of 0.06-0.6% is encouraging, especially the 0.064% result for Itokawa from only 3 lightcurve sessions. The period search module (Lomb-Scargle + chi-squared refinement) correctly identifies the true period in the candidate set even when joint optimization shifts the final value. Our per-lightcurve efficiency may be competitive with established tools.",
      "automation": "Our pipeline runs end-to-end without manual intervention, unlike MPO LCInvert's wizard-based workflow. This enables batch processing of hundreds of asteroids.",
      "non_convex_capability": "The GA-based non-convex refinement module (SAGE-inspired) represents functionality that MPO LCInvert lacks entirely and that SAGE has not publicly released. Our Itokawa result (IoU 0.34, 25% vertices non-convex) shows the GA is producing non-trivial non-convex deformations.",

Published convex inversion models typically use 30-78 lightcurves. The 3-7x data advantage enjoyed by published tools likely accounts for a substantial fraction of their accuracy advantage. A fairer comparison would normalize by data volume or test all tools on identical ALCDEF subsets.",
      "metric_incompatibility": "Published tools do not report IoU or Hausdorff distance. SAGE reports qualitative visual similarity; KOALA reports volume and dimension accuracy in percent; convex inversion reports lightcurve residual RMS. Cross-tool shape comparison requires standardized metrics that the community has not yet adopted.",
      "ground_truth_limitation": "Our ground-truth shapes are triaxial ellipsoid approximations of the true spacecraft-derived shapes. This artificially depresses IoU values for all tested shapes. With proper ground-truth models, IoU values would be different (possibly higher or lower depending on how well ellipsoids approximate the true convex hull).",
      "algorithmic_maturity": "MPO LCInvert and the underlying convexinv code have been developed and refined over 25+ years. SAGE has been in development since ~2014. Our pipeline was built from scratch. The performance gap reflects both algorithmic maturity and the extensive parameter tuning that established tools have undergone.",
      "deep_learning_context": "Recent deep learning approaches (Tang et al. 2025) achieve IoU of 0.89 for non-convex region detection and millisecond inference times. These represent a potential future direction but require large training datasets and GPU infrastructure."

  "conclusion": "Our pipeline shows clear promise in period recovery, especially given its ability to work with limited data (3-27 lightcurve sessions vs 50-109 in published work). The 0.064% period error for Itokawa from only 3 sessions is particularly noteworthy. However, pole accuracy (23-69 deg) and lightcurve fit residuals (0.08-0.10 mag) need significant improvement to be competitive with the 5-10 deg pole accuracy and 0.01-0.03 mag residuals achieved by established tools. The highest-priority improvement is pole grid resolution and a two-stage optimization strategy that decouples period search from pole determination. Shape fidelity comparisons are currently limited by the use of triaxial ellipsoid ground-truth proxies; obtaining actual spacecraft-derived shape models would enable more meaningful shape accuracy assessment."
