  ],
  "summary": "Six tools/repositories catalogued. The most relevant open-source tool is convexinv (DAMIT), which provides the foundation for convex inversion in C. SAGE is not publicly available and must be reimplemented. ADAM provides the most complete multi-modal framework but requires MATLAB. Our pipeline will reimplement the core algorithms in Python, synthesizing convex inversion (convexinv approach), genetic non-convex optimization (SAGE approach), and sparse data handling (Durech/Cellino approach) into a unified framework."
